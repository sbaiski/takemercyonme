This is supposed to be a simple slide and catch game.  I have spent at least ten hours working on this.  The basket is too small and does not catch the items and the timer does not work.  I have worked extremely hard just to have the image work.
Please take the time to enjoy moving the miniscule basket and watching the images fall.  The game is supposed to be catching laundry, representing my constant struggle to stay less behind on the laundry for my family of six
I am a little disappointed the game does not completely work, but I got disheartened and did not commit as much time to this project as I should have in order to make it work properly.  
I am pretty sure I used the game design as appropriately as possible.  I am a novice
Please take mercy on me, I got into grad school and would like to do well in this class for gpa purposes.
